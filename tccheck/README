README for tccheck.py


What it is:
===========
This Python script is an integrity checker for full-disc encrypted
TrueCrypt volumes, which can be used to check whether your TrueCrypt
volume has been compromised by (governmental) malware, such as a bootkit
or a keylogger.

So far, it has been tested on TrueCrypt 7.1a but it might work on
older/newer versions of TrueCrypt as well. The script may still falsely
report unknown TrueCrypt versions due to the following reasons:

- the script has not extensively been tested and may contain bugs
- the version of TrueCrypt that has been used to encrypt the disc/image
  is not (yet) supported by the script


How it works:
=============
The script reads particular parts of the TrueCrypt Master Boot Record (MBR)
and creates a SHA-256 hash of each of these parts. These hashes are then
compared to hashes that are known to belong to TrueCrypt. 

Unknown MBR components will be reported to the user, and can optionally be
written to a user-defined path for further analysis.

How to use:
===========
It is highly recommended to boot into a live operating system from a
read-only medium (CD/DVD). Please also make sure to run the script using
administrative privileges.

The script's syntax on the command line is as follows:

python tccheck.py <device> [path]

device: can be either an image file of a TrueCrypt volume or a TrueCrypt
        volume device's name

path:   (optional) existing path that will be used to create output files


The following example opens the device '\\.\PhysicalDrive0' and writes
output files to the current directory:

>python tccheck.py \\.\PhysicalDrive0 .
* bootsector.bin: OK
* decompressor.bin: OK
* bootloader.gz: OK
* backupBootloader.gz: OK

done.
