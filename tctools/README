wraps a simple obfuscator, such as an add-xor-rol encoder around
the truecrypt bootloader for whole-disc-encrypted drives.
this might prevent forensic software to detect drives that
have been encrypted with truecrypt and/or might prevent "evil maid attacks".

TODO:
currently, tctools.py supports modification/obfuscation of
the first ~ 0x200 bytes only which is insufficient since
the truecrypt bootloader will load and execute a few more
sectors. support for those needs to be added (probably
by overwriting existing, less 'useful' functions such as
the print function).

nb: this is experimental stuff, use at your own risk!
